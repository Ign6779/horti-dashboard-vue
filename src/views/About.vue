    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      The Horti Project is part of the Biomimicry lectorate at InHolland University of Applied Sciences. This group explores how biological principles can help solve real-world problems. One of their flagship innovations is the <strong>Flappy Drone</strong>: a drone that mimics bird-like wing movement rather than using propellers. This design is safer for greenhouse environments, minimizing the risk of damaging plants.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      While working on the drone, project lead <strong>Mauro Gallo</strong> encountered a recurring challenge: finding reliable, consolidated, and free information about crops, pests, and diseases online was incredibly difficult. Much of the data was fragmented or hidden behind paywalls. To solve this, the team launched the <strong>Hortidatabase</strong>, a free, open-access platform that brings together scientific knowledge gathered through research and experimentation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      What started as a data repository soon expanded. The project now includes a <strong>risk analysis tool</strong> that calculates when action is economically justified based on pest density, crop type, and market value. In other words, it helps growers make smarter, cost-effective decisions about treatments like pesticide use.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      As the Flappy Drone aims to operate fully autonomously, it also needs visual intelligence. That led to the integration of an <strong>AI detection model</strong>, which allows users to upload images or videos of their crops and receive automated feedback on possible pest or disease presence. In future updates, this system will also estimate pest density and provide tailored recommendations.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      At its core, the Horti system is about <strong>accessibility and transparency</strong>. Every tool and dataset we build is free to use, always. We don’t sell your data or charge for access. Instead, we rely entirely on external sponsors who support open research and innovation in sustainable agriculture.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Some features require logging in. This is only to help us understand our users better, whether you're a grower, researcher, student, or enthusiast. Your feedback shapes what we build next.

      Thank you for being part of this journey. Together, we’re building a smarter, greener future for horticulture.
